 <h5> This is the second approach, using an encoder-decoder RNN model created in PyTorch. <h5/>
 <h5> This approach is based on the seq2seq translation tutorial provided by PyTorch - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html <h5/>
 <h5> These results are significantly better, confirming my suspicion that the first approach was incorrect. <h5/>
